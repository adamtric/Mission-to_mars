# Mission-to_mars

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is adjust the web app that was previously developed to include four new images of Mars's different hemispheres. The web app's stylization and appearance will also be adjusted to make certain elements pop and fit the theme of the web app.

## Results

As evident by the images below, we were able to successfully import the images of Mars's hemispheres, along with there respective titles. By identifying the elements that contained these images, we were able to loop through these elements to pick out the image links and titles.

It is also evident that some webpage features have been transformed using Bootstrap styling components. We can see that the "Scrape New Data" button and the Mars Facts table were both altered with an Indian Red coloring and style. This was done by adding background colroing styles to their respective elements.
